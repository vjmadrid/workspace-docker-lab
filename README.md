# workspace-docker-lab

This workspace is a repository about **projects and PoCs** with **Docker**

Docker is a tool that facilitates the creation of distributable environments. To do this, you can specify a type operating system, the libraries you will use, their specific versions, the required environment variables, etc.

Objectives  :

* Allow to execute an application of isolated form inside that created environment
* Facilitate onboarding: provide the development environment when a new developer joins the team by providing an "all-in-one" environment.
* To have different environments of development in "my machine" when working in an isolated way by changing a platform, technological stack, etc becomes an easy task (it can be changed without leaving many traces of other installations).
* Facilitates distribution so that once assembled and transferred to another person, this person can use it in the same conditions as when it was generated.
* Provides the ability to mount development environments more similar to the real : DEV, UAT, QA, PRE , PRO , etc.

> Operation
>
>To do this, Docker creates "containers" based on "images".
>These containers contain everything necessary to operate and although each has its own consumption of HW resources the interesting thing is their way of sharing and making use of resources based on a layered file system -> so they consume less resources than other systems such as a virutal machine.


## Technological Stack

* Windows 10
* Docker (https://www.docker.com/)
* Node 8.10


## Prerequisites

Define what elements are needed to install the software

* Docker installed (Version 18.09.2 required)


## Installation

The installation of Docker depends on the platform

Each project/library has its form


## Testing

Each project/library has its form


## Deploy

Each project/library has its form


## Use

## Problems

Help for problems section

### Windows Problem

It is advisable to execute a terminal in administrator mode execute the following commands

```bash
